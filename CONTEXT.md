# GitTree — Context

GitTree is a desktop Git client (Electron) that presents a local repository's
history as a multi-lane graph and runs **explicit, reversible git operations**.
Privacy-first: no accounts, no telemetry, no repository upload.

## Domain language

- **Main Application** — the import-safe composition root in
  `main-application.js`; it constructs services, registers IPC, owns windows and
  exposes deterministic `start()`/`stop()`. `main.js` only injects Electron and
  starts it.
- **Application runtime** — the host lifecycle and deep-link readiness policy in
  `application-runtime.js`; it owns Electron event subscriptions, not services.
- **Repository** — a git working tree registered in the workspace (the app only
  operates on registered repositories; `assertManagedRepo`).
- **Repository workspace** — the main-process capability that owns Repository
  admission, canonical identity, active/persisted entries, GitService reuse and
  queue identity. Renderer paths are admitted only after a native directory
  selection, an approved scan, clone completion or a validated deep link.
- **Repository session** — the internal Git unit that owns a normalized path,
  the `simple-git` Adapter and one per-repository queue while `GitService`
  remains the stable public Interface.
- **Repository workspace controller** — the renderer lifecycle owner for one
  Repository activation. It restores view state, gives the graph first visual
  priority, coordinates supporting reads and prevents stale tab loads from
  publishing after a newer activation.
- **Workspace state controller** — the renderer owner of history/changes/review
  modes, sidebar and inspector visibility, accessibility attributes and their
  persisted state. Motion and realtime resize remain separate collaborators.
- **Shortcut controller** — the renderer owner of platform-specific shortcut
  labels and global keyboard dispatch. It ignores editable and modal contexts
  and removes its document listener deterministically.
- **Repository history** — the read-only Git capability for log, graph, refs,
  commit comparisons and commit diff/detail queries within one Repository
  session.
- **Repository working tree** — the Git capability that observes status,
  creates Working tree snapshots and owns safe file/hunk stage, unstage and
  discard operations.
- **Repository operations** — the Git capability that owns the complete
  preflight, execution, conflict and recovery cycle for merge, rebase and
  cherry-pick, including operation-state detection and conflict resolution.
- **Working tree snapshot** — a content-addressed fingerprint (sha256 of branch,
  per-file status, sizes, mtimes and index state) that guards stage/unstage/
  discard operations against concurrent changes.
- **Operation state** — an in-progress merge/rebase/cherry-pick detected from
  git state files; blocks destructive actions until continued, skipped or aborted.
- **Per-repo queue** — every async git operation on a `GitService` runs
  serialized through a promise chain keyed by the common Git directory;
  linked worktrees therefore share ref serialization while unrelated
  repositories stay parallel. `AsyncLocalStorage` keeps nested calls re-entrant.
- **Conflict block** — a `<<<<<<<`/`=======`/`>>>>>>>` region parsed from a
  conflicted file for the visual resolver.
- **Hosting provider adapter** — the provider-specific Implementation of the
  normalized pull-request Interface. GitHub, GitLab and Azure endpoint details,
  payloads and fallbacks stay behind this Seam.
- **AI capability** — the main-process capability that generates commit
  messages and pull-request descriptions through a user-configured provider
  (OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic or the local OpenCode CLI). Keys live in the
  encrypted vault, requests happen only on explicit user action, prompts are
  diff-bounded and outputs are parsed from a strict `TITLE:`/`BODY:` format.

## Architecture

- **Main process** (`src/main/`) — `main.js` is a side-effect-only entry point;
  `main-application.js` is the tested composition root, `application-runtime.js`
  owns host lifecycle, and domain handlers live in `src/main/ipc/`.
  `RepositoryWorkspace` owns admission and GitService
  identity. `GitService` and `HostingService` are stable Interfaces
  over deeper internal Modules and provider Adapters.
- **Git implementation** — `git-service.js` exposes the public capability while
  `src/main/git/` owns Repository sessions, Repository history, Repository
  working tree, Repository operations and cohesive Implementations. Git
  commands use `simple-git` or `execFile` argv arrays, never a shell string.
- **Hosting implementation** — `hosting-service.js` orchestrates credentials,
  authentication, retries and normalized errors. `src/main/hosting/providers/`
  owns provider-specific pull-request behavior.
- **AI implementation** — `src/main/ai/` owns the AiService facade, provider
  adapters, prompt building, output parsing and agent environment export;
  `ai-service.js` is the stable public Interface.
- **Preload** (`src/preload.js`) — the only bridge: an explicit, whitelisted
  `window.gitTree` API. The inspector window uses a dedicated minimal preload.
- **Renderer** (`src/renderer/`) — bento workspace with components per surface
  and small controller Modules for repository loading, remote operations,
  workspace state and motion. Prefer `textContent`; when markup is required,
  use the shared HTML encoder. CSP is `default-src 'self'`.
- **IPC contract** — handlers return `{ error }` instead of rejecting with
  strings; every git/hosting/terminal handler validates the repository path
  against the registered repo set.

## Conventions

- Conventional Commits (`feat`/`fix`/`perf`/`refactor`/`style` bump; `feat` and
  breaking → minor on the 0.x line, the rest → patch).
- ESLint flat config, error-level rules, enforced in CI.
- Every feature ships English + Italian i18n keys (enforced by
  `test/i18n-parity.test.js`).
- Design rules live in `DESIGN.md` and are audited by `npm run audit:design`
  (opaque surfaces, semantic tokens, transform/opacity-only motion).
- Refactors start with characterization tests, move one complete capability at
  a time, and end with `npm run quality`. Each checkpoint must remain
  independently revertible.
- Decision records: `docs/adr/`.
